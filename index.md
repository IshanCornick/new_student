## HACKS

During my time setting up my wesbite/blog there were somethings that I wished I knew before I started.

One of the things I wish I knew before I started was a list of some commands like:

cd - change directory

  Ex: cd student

make - launchs local host

make clean = stops and launchs local host to "clean it"

ls - shows what files are in the directory

Another thing I wish I knew before I started was that when you type code it is automaticly added to your local host. If you want it on your github you need to commit and sync it. 

The final thing I wish I knew was that for gifs and videos you need a embeaded link and that a normal link doesn't work.


## Problems I came across

One of my first problems was getting a computer. When I first started this class I had only a chromebook, when I realized a macbook would make everything much easier I ordered one. A couple days later it came but now I had much less time to work on my blog.

My second problems was with when I forked the wrong directory. After talking to a helper I realized this was a problem and I instead made a copy to fix this.

My third and finally problem was that my website wasn't big enough to hold all my code and writing. I realized the problem was my game that was messing with the sizing. I fixed this by instead using a calculator.
