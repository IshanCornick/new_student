### PBL Unit 1 / Week 0
Learning outcome.  Installing Tools and showing usage of VSCode.
- Wednesday - I picked Lincoln as my partner. We talked and discuss that I should buy a computer so that it would be easier to do this class.
- Thursday - On day 2 I still didn't have my new computer so I mainly helped my partner and listened to the talks.
- Friday - I had now ordered a computer and was just waiting. My partner has download almost everything but was having trouble with make. I help him fix it with bundle install.
