## Basic Commands

During my time setting up my wesbite/blog there were somethings that I wished I knew before I started.

One of the things I wish I knew before I started was a list of some commands like:

cd - change directory

  Ex: cd student

make - launchs local host

make clean = stops and launchs local host to "clean it"

ls - shows what files are in the directory

git clone < link > -  Clones github repository

Another thing I wish I knew before I started was that when you type code it is automaticly added to your local host. If you want it on your github you need to commit and sync it. 

The final thing I wish I knew was that for gifs and videos you need a embeaded link and that a normal link doesn't work.
