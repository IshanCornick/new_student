[3:40 PM] NEXT # JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Functions Review
## Description:
The provided code demonstrates various aspects of JavaScript DOM manipulation and functions. Below is a detailed review:
## Accessing DOM Elements:
Example #1 shows the use of document.getElementById to access an HTML element by its ID.
The retrieved element is logged to the console, illustrating the structure of the DOM.
## Getting Data within HTML Element:
Example #2 introduces the use of .innerHTML to retrieve data within an HTML element.
The inner HTML of the element is logged, showcasing how to access the content.
## Setting Data within HTML Element:
Example #3 demonstrates updating the inner HTML of an element using the assignment operator.
The updated inner HTML is logged to the console.
## Creating Elements:
Example #4 creates a new p element using document.createElement and sets its content.
The new element is logged, highlighting the process of element creation.
## Issue and Solution - Placing Element in HTML:
Example #5 addresses the issue of the created element not being placed in the HTML.
The solution involves using appendChild to add the element to a specified location in the HTML.
## Functions in JavaScript with DOM:
Example #6 defines a function (createPTag) that creates a p element with specified text.
The function is used to create a p element, which is then added to the HTML.
## OnClick Event:
Example #7 introduces the OnClick event, triggering the creation of a p element when a button is clicked.
Two functions (createPTag and addPTagOnButton) are used in conjunction with the event.
## Conclusion:
The code effectively covers various aspects of DOM manipulation and functions in JavaScript. It provides a comprehensive understanding of accessing, modifying, and creating elements within the DOM. The use of functions enhances code readability and reusability.
[3:41 PM] NEXT # JavaScript Basics - Console, Variables, Operators, and Conditional Statements
## Description:
The provided code covers fundamental JavaScript concepts, including console output, data types, operators, and conditional statements. Below is a detailed review:
## Console Output:
Example #1 demonstrates the use of console.log to output text to the console.
Clear instructions are provided on how to view the console in various browsers.
## Storing Data:
The section emphasizes the importance of understanding how data is stored in programming, introducing the concept of Data Abstraction.
Basic data types in JavaScript (string, number, boolean) are explained.
## Name the Data and Accessing Data:
The process of creating variables using the var keyword and accessing data by using the variable name is explained.
Examples #3 and #4 show the creation of variables and logging them along with their types.
## String Operators:
Example #5 illustrates string concatenation and string comparison using operators like == and !==.
The assignment operator (=) is demonstrated for changing the value of a variable.
## Number Operators:
Example #6 covers number operators (+, -, *, /, %) and their usage.
Number comparison with operators like ===, !==, <, >, <=, and >= is demonstrated.
## Conditional Statements:
Example #7 introduces conditional statements (if, else if, else) based on the example of setting an alarm.
Clear explanations and comments accompany the code, making it beginner-friendly.
## Conditional Statements + Operators:
Example #8 extends the use of conditional statements by incorporating comparison operators.
The if, else if, else structure is utilized to handle different cases.
## Conclusion:
The code effectively covers foundational concepts of JavaScript, providing a solid introduction to variables, operators, and conditional statements. It serves as a beginner-friendly resource for understanding essential programming principles.
[3:41 PM] NEXT # JavaScript - Debugging
## Hack 1 Changes Made:
Introduced a variable letterNumber to represent the position of the alphabet letter.
Used a for loop to iterate through alphabetList.
Checked if the current index i matches the specified letterNumber.
If there's a match, printed the corresponding alphabet letter and its position.
## Feedback:
The loop condition in for (var i = 0; i < alphabetList; i++) should be for (var i = 0; i < alphabetList.length; i++) to iterate over the array properly.
The printed output message includes a hardcoded "1" in "is letter number 1 in the alphabet". It should be the actual position.
Review for Segment 3: Odd Numbers
## Hack 2 Changes Made:
Corrected the loop condition to while (i < 10) to print odd numbers below 10.
Adjusted the loop increment to i += 2 to ensure odd numbers are pushed into the array.
## Feedback:
The loop condition while (i < 10) should be while (i <= 10) to include the number 10.
The variable name evens is misleading; consider renaming it to odds for clarity.
Review for Segment 4: Filtering Numbers
## Hack 3 Changes Made:
Adjusted the loop condition to while (i <= 100) to include 100.
In the for loop, directly iterate through the array elements rather than using for (var i of numbers).
## Feedback:
The loop condition while (i < 100) is correct, but the loop could be simplified as for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++).
The logic inside the loop could be improved to correctly filter multiples of 2 or 5.
Review for Challenge: Menu Calculation
## Hack 4 Changes Made:
Added a function calculateTotal(item) to calculate the total cost based on the selected menu item.
Updated the code to call this function for the specified item ("burger"). Added all other items present to calculate the total.
## Feedback:
The toFixed(2) method is used to round the menu item prices to two decimal places, which is a good practice for currency representation.
The code should be expanded to handle multiple items and accumulate the total cost.
## Conclusion:
The provided code shows understanding of basic JavaScript concepts. Feedback provided aims to enhance correctness and clarity. Further improvements could be made based on the specific comments for each code segment.

[3:46 PM] This is at the very top # Week 5
## Review Ticket
### What We Did:
This week we worked on our Web Development test. Ishan Lincoln Sergi and I worked on the hacks and practiced to present them. We input and ran the code and made sure we were prepared.
### Issues for this week:
First, we had an issue in where some of our running code wasn't disposing our preferred output. After "swapping" the links on js with HTML the expected output of "switched" wasn't appearing. We added a missing piece of code to resolve our issues. Lincoln and I had issues with our teacher repository not updating the new files, we tried committing and pulling, which fortunately worked for me but Lincoln had to create a new teacher repository.
