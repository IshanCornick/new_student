# Prep
Preparing for the Computer Science Principles (CSP) 2020 Practice Exam 1 Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ) on College Board was an intellectually enriching journey that allowed me to delve into the intricate realm of various computer science concepts. The entire preparatory process was not merely an exercise in rote memorization but a comprehensive exploration of fundamental principles that form the bedrock of computer science education.

In the initial stages of my preparation, I dedicated substantial time to immersing myself in the extensive and well-crafted materials provided by College Board. This foundational step ensured a robust grasp of essential computer science concepts, ranging from algorithms and programming languages to data representation and the societal impacts of computing. This immersive approach was pivotal in laying the groundwork for a nuanced understanding that transcended mere surface-level knowledge.

# Collaboration
Collaboration emerged as a cornerstone of my preparation strategy. The collective wisdom of fellow students played a transformative role in enhancing my comprehension of complex topics. Engaging in student-led discussions, I found myself navigating through past papers and sample questions with peers, allowing for a dynamic exchange of insights. This collaborative effort not only familiarized me with the specific nuances of the exam format but also served as a means to identify and address areas that required further attention.

The significance of shared learning was further underscored through active participation in study groups. These group sessions became a crucible of intellectual exploration where challenging concepts were dissected, insights were exchanged, and mutual teaching reinforced our collective understanding. The interactive nature of these discussions not only facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject matter but also fostered a sense of camaraderie among peers on the journey toward academic excellence.

Teammate collaboration added yet another dimension to my preparation. Engaging in team projects and coding exercises allowed for the practical application of theoretical knowledge. This hands-on approach not only honed our problem-solving skills but also illuminated the real-world applications of the computer science principles we were studying. The synthesis of theory and practice in a team setting served as a powerful catalyst for a holistic understanding of the subject matter.

# Team Teaches
An additional tool that significantly contributed to my preparation was Team Teachs. This innovative approach facilitated learning from peers, a method I found to be particularly effective. By delving into their chosen topics and participating in MCQs on their homework assignments, I gleaned insights from diverse perspectives, reinforcing my understanding of the material.

As the exam date loomed closer, I continued to refine my understanding through self-assessment and sought feedback from both peers and instructors. Analyzing mistakes became a valuable tool for identifying specific areas of improvement, allowing me to fine-tune my knowledge base. The culmination of these efforts resulted in a sense of preparedness and confidence on the day of the CSP 2020 Practice Exam 1 MCQ.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the practice exam, despite lacking time constraints, provided a unique opportunity for a holistic learning journey. The fusion of individual study, student-led discussions, and teammate collaboration not only elevated my academic performance but also underscored the collaborative essence inherent in computer science education. The journey toward mastery was not merely a solitary pursuit; it was a collective endeavor that epitomized the collaborative and dynamic nature of the field.

## Corrections

# Q10

Chosen: A

Correct: B

Why? : A, would not add 2 dollars for the extra tour, B it the same as A but includes the extra cost for the tour.

# Q10

Chosen: B

Correct: A

Why? : B because 11110000 = 240 not 224 like in B.

# Q10

Chosen: B

Correct: A

Why? : B because 11110000 = 240 not 224 like in B.

# Q14

Chosen: A

Correct: B

Why? : B because as said in the problem it is interger quotient and not remainder. Misclick on my part.

# Q16

Chosen: B

Correct: C

Why? : B would still allow it to continue. To stop it you must make it less than 1 and subtract instead of add (difference from B to C)

# Q20

Chosen: B

Correct: A

Why? : B because as shown in the pie chart 10 MB is the average per user.

# Q23

Chosen: B

Correct: D

Why? : D because as shown in the table is it miles <> 20 not miles >= 20.

# Q32

Chosen: B

Correct: D

Why? : Final grades would be divided as shown in the example not the sum of the values.

# Q37

Chosen: C

Correct: A

Why? : The first line as shown in the graph should be straight, this means drawing the line should become first because the move of 2. 

# Q40

Chosen: C

Correct: D

Why? : Why doing this question I was confused what certifcate authority were. We a google search I can see the answer is D.

# Q41

Chosen: D

Correct: C

Why? : "Statement II is incorrect. It will first call TrimRight to remove the eleven rightmost characters, which includes more than just the file extension. It will then pass the result to TrimLeft to remove the four leftmost characters, which does not remove the entire date tag." This means only III is right

# Q48

Chosen: B

Correct: C

Why? : B is not an example of phishing, C is though as they are looking for your info through a link.

# Q52

Chosen: D

Correct: A

Why? : Only I is correct, II is wrong. I is the entire point of the simulation the others are different simulations.

# Q60

Chosen: B

Correct: D

Why? : You need to get rid of the duplicates to make the list unique with only unique numbers.

# Q61

Chosen: B, C, D

Correct: B, D

Why? : C is wrong as restricting access to the internet for certain ages would increase the digital divide.

# Q65

Chosen: C

Correct: C, B

Why? : B and C are correct because the order that you set variables for this code does not matter and would still result in the same thing.

# Q66

Chosen: B, C

Correct: A, C

Why? : A is correct as you do not need to increase count by 1 in the start. B is wrong as you dont need to increase count inbetween.

# Q67

Chosen: B

Correct: A, B

Why? : B would also work as order doesnt matter and both have the correct trees in there list.
