## What I did
In week 0 I didn't get much done. I just read the blogs on the website and watch others because I didnt have a computer. The computer is planned to come to on tuesday. I am now far behind and when I get my computer I need to go fast.

## What I wish I did
I wish I got a computer earlier so that I could start downlaoding my software and getting ready for the first live review.
