### What I did 

In this week I worked on my juypter notebook and my blogs/ compsci tabs. I added hacks from past weeks and games. I also added a brand new calculator using chat gpt. Chat gpt was helped me a lot during this stage with code and problems. I also included plans for the future about what I hope/will do.


### What I wish I did

I wish I wrote down my plans from previous weeks so that the plans from the past would be more accurate. Right now past plans are close guesses.
