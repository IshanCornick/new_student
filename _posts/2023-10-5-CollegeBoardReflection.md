# Results
On my college board I got a 63/66. I think I did pretty good and got lucky on some of my guess but could of done better if I slowed down and read the full problem. All the problems I got wrong were at the end showing how I was rushing towards the end.

## Corrections

# Q54: 

A programmer notices the following two procedures in a library. The procedures do similar, but not identical, things.

Procedure Square, open parenthesis, n, close parenthesis returns the value N squared.
Procedure Cube, open parenthesis, n, close parenthesis returns the value N raised to the third power.
Which of the following procedures is a generalization of the procedures described above?

A. Procedure Add, open parenthesis n comma m, close parenthesis, which returns the value n + m

B. Procedure Fourth, open parenthesis, n, close parenthesis , which returns the value N raised to the fourth power

C. Procedure Polynomial, open parenthesis, c, close parenthesis, which returns the value N raised to the third power plus n squared

D. Procedure Power, open parenthesis, n comma m, close parenthesis, which returns the value N raised to the m power

I chose B as the answer but the correct answer is D. Even thought B does the same thing but rather to the 4 the question asks for it to be generalized meaning for all exponants making D the correct option and you can input any values.

# Q58:

Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

Which of the following are true statements about how the Internet enables crowdsourcing?

I. The Internet can provide crowdsourcing participants access to useful tools, information, and professional knowledge.

II. The speed and reach of the Internet can lower geographic barriers, allowing individuals from different locations to contribute to projects.

III. Using the Internet to distribute solutions across many users allows all computational problems to be solved in reasonable time, even for very large input sizes.
A. I and II only
B. I and III only
C. II and III only
D. I, II, and III

I chose D but the correct answer is A. D is not the correction answer because III is false. We can not assume it will be solved in reasonable time. This makes only I and II true making A the correct answer.

# Q60:

Directions: For the question or incomplete statement below, two of the suggested answers are correct. For this question, you must select both correct choices to earn credit. No partial credit will be earned if only one correct choice is selected. Select the two that are best in each case.

Which of the following are ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program?

Select two answers.
A. Replacing each instance of repeated code with a call to a procedure
B. Replacing longer variable names with shorter variable names to reduce typing errors
C. Replacing several lines of documentation with a single line of documentation
D. Replacing several lines of documentation with a single line of documentation One word, name 1, One word, name 2, One word, name 3, and One word, name 4 with a list of strings
called names

I chose B and C as the answer but the correct answer is A and D. Even thought B and C make the code easier to understand and simplier it does not use abstraction like asked in the prompt making A and D the correct answer.
