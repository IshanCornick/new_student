## What I did 

This week I got my computer on tuesday. Now with my computer I started to catch up and prepare for the live review. I started downloading everything for my wesbite. I added fun facts about myself, pictures, gifs and videos. I went above and beyond by also adding a calculator and doing my website on github.io. I got a 1.9 on my first live review.

# What I wish I did

This week me and my partner were having different issues and did colaborate as much as I think we should of. I think we should of colaborted more and worked together to build our understanding and ability to work together.
