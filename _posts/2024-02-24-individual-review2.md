Condensed Project Overview:

Our project is mainly focused around something everyone in my group enjoys, video games. Video games was something we could all agree on and something we enjoy playing regularly. Even though we all love video games there should only be a certain amount you should play a day, and thats why we made this project. Our project focuses on putting games right next to education and physical hubs so they are easy to access and motivate our users to while enjoying the game to do other things. Our project has features that help and give you tips on physical health and help studying and finding out what level of education you are at, while also letting the users relax and play games.

What I did:

Frontend -  First Trimester I did frontend so I have a good understanding of it and was able to do most of it. 
- Helped on the frontend making of the login.
- I made the physical hub, with the quiz and calories calculator. 
- I made the game hub along with all 3 of the games on it.
- I made the education hub with the 2 activies on that hub. 
- The final thing I made on the frontend was the main hub. 

Backend - For this project I wanting to be able to do backend as previously in first trimester I only did frontend.
- Helped on the backend error fixing for the login.

My Feature:

My feature is the physical hub that helps give tips to the users about how they should workout and what food they should eat to better there physical health. With a quick login and quiz you can have recommendations that are saved to your user and put into the database. If anything changes about you, you can retake the quiz and get new recommendations.

### Component A: Program Code

| Collegeboard Requirements | Me |
|---------------------------|----|
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file. | My feature takes in your information and is able to give you suggestions about workouts and diet. If logged in the recommendations are saved to the user. |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose. | An example of a list is for the questions asked in the quiz. After the quiz an example of collection of data is shown as the information is collect to give a response which is saved to the user. That response that is saved is then added to the data table. |
| At least one procedure that contributed to the programâ€™s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters: | This procedure has a name(post), a return(response), and parameters(self): procedure <a href="https://ibb.co/XzrjSP1"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Wc4GgXZ/Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-1-15-38-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-1-15-38-PM" border="0" /></a> |
| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure | This function shows the sequencing, selection, and iteration through the diet and workout: sequencing <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/m9NCkW8/Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-1-21-09-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-1-21-09-PM" border="0" /></a> |

| Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or ) based on input and program functionality | My feature outputs 2 things. First after you finish the quiz it outputs the recommendations. Second after it saves to the user it outputs it and saves it in a datatable <a href="https://ibb.co/kJnQdgJ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/dt9Gh0t/Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-1-27-08-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-1-27-08-PM" border="0" /></a> |
