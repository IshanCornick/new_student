## Some hacks / things to know:

## Cmds

bundle exec jekyll serve --force-polling - fixes when make isn't working

## Tips

If link doesnt work make sure it has only one /new_student/ in it.

If link to blog isnt appearing make sure it is a .md

For code and python use a .ipynb

If commit doesnt work do it manually or wait till github is back up.
