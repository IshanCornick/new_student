    "- I deployed AWS after failed attempts from teammates with the help of other classmates and teachers.\n",
    "- I used other another api for my image searcher but did not use it for the flash cards to show 2 different things while not making it to similar.\n",

The process of creating algorithms involves several key steps and considerations:\n",

    "## Understanding the Problem\n",
    "\n",

    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a well-designed algorithm, you can implement it in your preferred programming language. In Python, you can use the `def` keyword to define functions that encapsulate the algorithm's logic. Follow best coding practices and add comments to improve code readability.\n",

    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is a programming concept that involves hiding the complex details of how data is stored and manipulated while providing a simplified interface for interacting with that data. This concept is achieved through the use of classes and objects in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithms and Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures used to solve specific problems or accomplish tasks efficiently. They play a fundamental role in computer science, mathematics, and various other fields. Algorithms are essential for structured problem-solving and have applications in a wide range of areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulations** involve using algorithms to model and analyze real-world processes or systems. In simulations, algorithms are employed to observe how a system behaves under different conditions. Simulations are widely used in fields such as computer science, engineering, and social sciences for experimentation and analysis.\n",

    "Python is a versatile tool for both algorithm development and simulations, as it allows you to implement and test algorithms and models for a wide variety of scenarios.\n",

    "    - Hierarchy: Files are organized into directories or folders, which can contain other files or subdirectories.\n",
    "    - File Attributes: Information associated with a file, such as size, type, and permissions.\n",
    "    - File Extensions: Typically denote the type or format of a file (e.g., .txt for text files, .jpg for image files).\n",
    "\n",
    "- File Naming Conventions and Permissions:\n",
    "    - File Naming Rules: Names can include letters, numbers, and special characters, with specific restrictions on length and character usage.\n",
    "    - Access Permissions (Read, Write, Execute): Determine what actions users can perform on a file (e.g., read-only, read-write).\n",

    "    - Protocols (e.g., TCP/IP): Rules governing how data is transmitted across a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OSI Model and Its Layers:\n",
    "    - Physical Layer: Concerned with the physical connection between devices.\n",
    "    - Data Link Layer: Responsible for reliable data transfer across a physical link.\n",
    "    - Network Layer: Manages routing and addressing to ensure data reaches its destination.\n",
    "    - Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices.\n",
    "    - Session Layer: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions or connections.\n",
    "    - Presentation Layer: Responsible for data formatting and encryption.\n",
    "    - Application Layer: Provides network services directly to end users.\n",

    "    - Since we were behind we werent sure what each job did and what were meant to do before\n",
    "    - We had to get rid of ideas that we already had work on as we realized we cant show python code on the site.\n",
    "    - We had a lot of trouble connecting our front and backend because we could not get the flask link, but we then figured out we had to edit our main.py more\n",
    "    - We couldn't seperate the information of each frog before when you clicked on them. But we fixed it by making different permalinks for the .mds and havinjg different functions for the on-click events.\n",
    "    - We had trouble deploying AWS as the ports were full, to fix this we connected to a CSA port and point towards CSA.\n",
    "2. Things I learned and accomplishments\n",
    "    - Despite our set backs, we still came out with a pretty good final product and our teamwork improved drastically.\n",
    "    - I learned how to interact with vscode and learnt JS and Python.\n",
    "    - I know how to make quizzes and flash cards with other apis and backend.\n",
